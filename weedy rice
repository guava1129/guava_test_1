With the exception of barnyardgrass, weedy rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the most competitive weed in rice production systems, resulting in severe yield loss. 
It is difficult to remove weedy rice from infested rice fields due to its undesired traits, including early shattering allowing weedy rice dispersal nearby.
The most annoying trait is that weedy rice is the species of genus Oryza, which causes morphological characteristics of weedy rice in early growing stage are similar with cultivated rice making their identification very difficult. 
The transmission and dispersal patterns of weedy rice seeds could be classified to three types. 
The first is from rice seeds, the second is from the soil seed bank, and the third is from pollen-mediated introgression.
Weedy rice varieties were previously produced for more than 50 years in Taiwan and were phased out in 1959.
Because of the outcrossing and introgression between japonica cultivated rice and TWR, weedy rice infestation is gradually serious.
Farmers in Taiwan usually adopt transplanted planting system (TPR) and continuous cropping system to cultivate rice and  TPR is thought to be a strategy of controlling weed disturbance.
However, weedy rice infestation has increasingly been reported as a major problem in some countries in Asia, including Malaysia, Japan and Taiwan.
